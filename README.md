# AlgorithmEvaluation
This repository will show my various forays into evaluating the speed of common algorithms.

Notes:

-Ideally I would have used a header file for the searches and sorts and then just included it to minimize code clutter here. However, the requirements were for each file to be standalone and thus that option was not available.

-I am planning on sweeping through and creating a header file rather than leaving them as is.
