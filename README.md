# AlgorithmEvaluation
This repository will show my various forays into evaluating the speed of common algorithms.

Notes:

-Ideally I would have used a header file for the searches and sorts and then just included it to minimize code clutter here. However, the requirements were for each file to be standalone and thus that option was not available.

-Note to self: come thorugh and de-clutter this code. There is value here; just need to clean up a bit first.
